# Arduino-Based Smartphone Charging Controller  

## Overview  
This project is an **Arduino-powered smartphone charging controller** designed to **prevent overcharging** and **optimize battery life**. It allows users to set a **charging timer** using a **rotary encoder and LCD display**, ensuring controlled and efficient charging.  

## Features  
- üîã **Overcharge Protection**: Prevents excessive charging to extend battery life.  
- ‚è≥ **User-Controlled Charging Timer**: Users can set a timer via a **rotary encoder** and **LCD display**.  
- ‚ö° **Efficient Power Management**: Automatically stops charging once the set time is reached.  
- üîå **Plug & Play Design**: Simple setup with an Arduino-based circuit.  

## Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino UNO (or any compatible board)  
- **Programming Language**: C++ (Arduino IDE)  
- **Components**: LCD Display, Rotary Encoder, Resistors, MOSFET, Power Supply  
- **Development Environment**: Arduino IDE  

## How It Works  
1. **User sets charging time** using the rotary encoder.  
2. **The LCD display** shows the selected duration.  
3. **Once started, the system allows charging** for the specified time.  
4. **Charging is automatically cut off** after the timer expires, preventing overcharging.
